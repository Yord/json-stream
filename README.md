## Installation

Installation is done using [`npm`][npm-install].

```bash
$ npm i -g pxi
```

Try `pxi --help` to see if the installation was successful.

## Features

+   ðŸ§š **Small**: [Pixie does one thing and does it well][unix-philosophy].
+   :zap: **Fast:** `pxi` is as fast as `gawk`, 3x faster than `jq` and `mlr`, and 20x faster than `fx`.
+   :sparkles: **Magical:** It is trivial to write your own ~~spells~~ *plugins*.
+   :smile_cat: **Playful:** Opt-in to more data formats by installing plugins.
+   :tada: **Versatile:** Use Ramda, Lodash and any other JavaScript library to process data on the command-line.
+   :heart: **Loving:** Pixie is made with love and encourages a positive and welcoming environment.

## Getting Started

<summary>
Pixie reads in big structured text files, transforms them with JavaScript functions, and writes them back to disk.
The usage examples in this section are based on the following large JSONL file.
Inspect the examples by clicking on them!

<p>

```bash
$ head -5 2019.jsonl # 2.6GB, 31,536,000 lines
```

</p>
</summary>

```json
{"time":1546300800,"year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":0}
{"time":1546300801,"year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":1}
{"time":1546300802,"year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":2}
{"time":1546300803,"year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":3}
{"time":1546300804,"year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":4}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Execute any JavaScript function:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi "json => json.time" < 2019.jsonl
$ pxi "({time}) => time" < 2019.jsonl
```

</p>
</summary>

You may use JavaScript arrow functions, destructuring, spreading,
and any other feature of your current NodeJS version.

```json
1546300800000
1546300801000
1546300802000
1546300803000
1546300804000
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Convert between JSON, CSV, SSV, and TSV:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi --deserializer json --serializer csv < 2019.jsonl > 2019.csv
$ pxi -d json -s csv < 2019.jsonl > 2019.csv
$ pxi --from json --to csv < 2019.jsonl > 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

Users may extend pixie with (third-party) plugins for many more data formats.
See the [`.pxi` module section][pxi-module] on how to do that and the [plugins](#plugins) section for a list.
Pixie deserializes data into JSON, applies functions, and serializes JSON to another format.
It offers the telling aliases `--from` and `--to` alternative to `--deserializer` and `--serializer`.

```json
time,year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds
1546300800,2019,1,1,0,0,0
1546300801,2019,1,1,0,0,1
1546300802,2019,1,1,0,0,2
1546300803,2019,1,1,0,0,3
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Use Ramda, Lodash or any other JavaScript library:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi "o(obj => _.omit(obj, ['seconds']), evolve({time: parseInt}))" --from csv < 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie may use any JavaScript library, including Ramda and Lodash.
Read the [`.pxi` module section][pxi-module] to learn more.

```json
{"time":1546300800,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0"}
{"time":1546300801,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0"}
{"time":1546300802,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0"}
{"time":1546300803,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0"}
{"time":1546300804,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0"}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Process data streams from REST APIs and other sources and pipe pixie's output to other commands:

<p>

```bash
$ curl -s "https://swapi.co/api/films/" |
  pxi 'json => json.results' --chunker jsonObj --applier flatMap --keep '["episode_id", "title"]' |
  sort
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie follows the [unix philosophy][unix-philosophy]:
It does one thing (processing structured data), and does it well.
It is written to work together with other programs and it handles text streams because that is a universal interface.

```json
{"episode_id":1,"title":"The Phantom Menace"}
{"episode_id":2,"title":"Attack of the Clones"}
{"episode_id":3,"title":"Revenge of the Sith"}
{"episode_id":4,"title":"A New Hope"}
{"episode_id":5,"title":"The Empire Strikes Back"}
{"episode_id":6,"title":"Return of the Jedi"}
{"episode_id":7,"title":"The Force Awakens"}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Use pixie's ssv deserializer to work with command line output:

<p>

```bash
$ ls -ahl / | pxi '([,,,,size,,,,file]) => ({size, file})' --from ssv
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie's space-separated values deserializer makes it very easy to work with the output of other commands.
Array destructuring is especially helpful in this area.

```json
{"size":"704B","file":"."}
{"size":"704B","file":".."}
{"size":"1.2K","file":"bin"}
{"size":"4.4K","file":"dev"}
{"size":"11B","file":"etc"}
{"size":"25B","file":"home"}
{"size":"64B","file":"opt"}
{"size":"192B","file":"private"}
{"size":"2.0K","file":"sbin"}
{"size":"11B","file":"tmp"}
{"size":"352B","file":"usr"}
{"size":"11B","file":"var"}
```

</details>

See the [usage](#usage) section below for more examples.

### Introductory Blogposts

For a quick start, read the following medium posts:

## ðŸ§š Pixie

Pixie's philosophy is to provide a small, extensible frame
for processing large files and streams with JavaScript functions.
Different data formats are supported through plugins.
JSON, CSV, SSV, and TSV are supported by default, but users can customize their pixie
installation by picking and choosing from more available (including third-party) plugins.

Pixie works its magic by chunking, deserializing, applying functions, and serializing data.
Expressed in code, it works like this:

```javascript
function pxi (data) {                // Data is passed to pxi from stdin.
  const chunks = chunk(data)         // The data is chunked.
  const jsons  = deserialize(chunks) // The chunks are deserialized into JSON objects. 
  const jsons2 = apply(f, jsons)     // f is applied to each object and new JSON objects are returned.
  const string = serialize(jsons2)   // The new objects are serialized to a string.
  process.stdout.write(string)       // The string is written to stdout.
}
```

For example, chunking, deserializing, and serializing JSON is provided by the [`pxi-json`][pxi-json] plugin.

### Plugins

The following plugins are available:

|                            | Chunkers  | Deserializers              | Appliers                   | Serializers                | `pxi` |
|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|:-----:|
| [`pxi-dust`][pxi-dust]     | `line`    |                            | `map`, `flatMap`, `filter` | `string`                   |   âœ“   |
| [`pxi-json`][pxi-json]     | `jsonObj` | `json`                     |                            | `json`                     |   âœ“   |
| [`pxi-dsv`][pxi-dsv]       |           | `csv`, `tsv`, `ssv`, `dsv` |                            | `csv`, `tsv`, `ssv`, `dsv` |   âœ“   |
| [`pxi-sample`][pxi-sample] | `sample`  | `sample`                   | `sample`                   | `sample`                   |   âœ•   |

The last column states which plugins come preinstalled in `pxi`.
Refer to the `.pxi` Module section to see how to enable more plugins and how to develop plugins.
New experimental pixie plugins are developed i.a. in the [`pxi-sandbox`][pxi-sandbox] repository.

### Performance

`pxi` is fast and beats several similar tools in [performance benchmarks][pxi-benchmarks]:

| [Benchmark][pxi-benchmarks] | Description                                   | `pxi` | `gawk` | `jq` | `mlr` | `fx` |

â€  `mlr` appears to load the whole file instead of processing it in chunks if reading JSON.
This is why it fails on large input files.
So in these benchmarks, the first 20,000,000 lines are processed first, followed by the remaining 11,536,000 lines.
The times of both runs are summed up.

Times are given in CPU time (seconds), wall-clock times may deviate by Â± 1s.
The benchmarks were run on a 13" MacBook Pro (2019) with a 2,8 GHz Quad-Core i7 and 16GB memory.
Since `pxi` and `fx` are written in JavaScript, they need more RAM (approx. 70 MB)
than `gawk` and `jq` that are written in C (approx. 1MB).
`mlr` needs the most RAM (up to 11GB), since it appears to load the whole file before processing it in some cases.
Feel free to run the [benchmarks][pxi-benchmarks] on your own machine
and if you do, please [open an issue][issues] to report your results!

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Select the time:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi "json => json.time" < 2019.jsonl
```

</p>
</summary>

Go ahead and use JavaScript's arrow functions.

```json
1546300800000
1546300801000
1546300802000
1546300803000
1546300804000
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Select month and day:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi '({month, day}) => ({month, day})' < 2019.jsonl
```

</p>
</summary>

Use destructuring and spread syntax.

```json
1546300800000
1546300801000
1546300802000
1546300803000
1546300804000
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Convert JSON to CSV:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi --from json --to csv < 2019.jsonl > 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie has deserializers (`--from`) and serializers (`--to`) for various data formats, including JSON and CSV.
JSON is the default deserializer and serializer, so no need to type `--from json` and `--to json`.

```json
time,year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds
1546300800,2019,1,1,0,0,0
1546300801,2019,1,1,0,0,1
1546300802,2019,1,1,0,0,2
1546300803,2019,1,1,0,0,3
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Convert JSON to CSV, but keep only time and month:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi '({time, month}) => [time, month]' --to csv < 2019.jsonl
```

</p>
</summary>

Serializers can be freely combined with functions.

```json
1546300800,1
1546300801,1
1546300802,1
1546300803,1
1546300804,1
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Rename time to timestamp and convert CSV to TSV:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi '({time, ...rest}) => ({timestamp: time, ...rest})' --from csv --to tsv < 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

Read in CSV format.
Use destructuring to select all attributes other than time.
Rename time to timestamp and keep all other attributes unchanged.
Write in TSV format.

```json
timestamp       year    month   day	    hours   minutes seconds
1546300800      2019    1       1       0       0       0
1546300801      2019    1       1       0       0       1
1546300802      2019    1       1       0       0       2
1546300803      2019    1       1       0       0       3
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Convert CSV to JSON:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi --deserializer csv --serializer json < 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

`--from` and `--to` are aliases for `--deserializer` and `--serializer` that are used to convert between formats.

```json
{"time":"1546300800","year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"0"}
{"time":"1546300801","year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"1"}
{"time":"1546300802","year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"2"}
{"time":"1546300803","year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"3"}
{"time":"1546300804","year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"4"}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Convert CSV to JSON and cast time to integer:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi '({time, ...rest}) => ({time: parseInt(time), ...rest})' -d csv < 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

Deserializing from CSV does not automatically cast strings to other types.
This is intentional, since some use cases may need casting, and others don't.
If you need a key to be an integer, you need to explicitly transform it.

```json
{"time":1546300800,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"0"}
{"time":1546300801,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"1"}
{"time":1546300802,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"2"}
{"time":1546300803,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"3"}
{"time":1546300804,"year":"2019","month":"1","day":"1","hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"4"}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Use Ramda (or Lodash):

<p>

```bash
$ pxi 'evolve({year: parseInt, month: parseInt, day: parseInt})' -d csv < 2019.csv
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie may use any JavaScript library, including Ramda and Lodash.
The [`.pxi` module section][pxi-module] tells you how to install them.

```json
{"time":"1546300800","year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"0"}
{"time":"1546300801","year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"1"}
{"time":"1546300802","year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"2"}
{"time":"1546300803","year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"3"}
{"time":"1546300804","year":2019,"month":1,"day":1,"hours":"0","minutes":"0","seconds":"4"}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Select only May the 4th:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi '({month, day}) => month == 5 && day == 4' --applier filter < 2019.jsonl
```

</p>
</summary>

Appliers determine how functions are applied.
The default applier is `map`, which applies the function to each element.
Here, we use the `filter` applier that keeps only elements for which the function yields true.

```json
{"time":1556928000,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":0}
{"time":1556928001,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":1}
{"time":1556928002,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":2}
{"time":1556928003,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":3}
{"time":1556928004,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":4}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Use more than one function:

<p>

```bash
$ pxi '({month}) => month == 5' '({day}) => day == 4' -a filter < 2019.jsonl
```

</p>
</summary>

Functions are applied in the given order on an element to element basis.
In this case, each element is first checked for the month, then for the day.

```json
{"time":1556928000,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":0}
{"time":1556928001,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":1}
{"time":1556928002,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":2}
{"time":1556928003,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":3}
{"time":1556928004,"year":2019,"month":5,"day":4,"hours":0,"minutes":0,"seconds":4}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Suppose you have to access a web API:

<p>

```bash
$ curl -s "https://swapi.co/api/people/"
```

</p>
</summary>

The returned JSON is in just one line and needs to be tamed.

```json
{"count":87,"next":"...","results":[{"name":"Luke Skywalker","height":"172","mass":"77" [...]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Use pixie to organize the response:

<p>

```bash
$ curl -s "https://swapi.co/api/people/" |
  pxi "json => json.results" --chunker jsonObj --applier flatMap --keep '["name","height","mass"]'
```

</p>
</summary>

Up until this point in the examples, data was organized in lines
and the default `line` chunker was used to break it down.
In this response, however, all data is in just one line (without a line ending) and we need a different chunker.
`jsonObj` identifies JSON objects in data and returns one object at a time.
Since the whole response is one big object, it is returned.
Next, the function is applied, which selects the results attribute.
If it were applied with `map`, it would return the results array as the only element.
But since we use the `flatMap` applier, each array item is returned as one element.
Finally, the `--keep` attribute specifies, which keys to keep from the returned objects:

```json
{"name":"Luke Skywalker","height":"172","mass":"77"}
{"name":"C-3PO","height":"167","mass":"75"}
{"name":"R2-D2","height":"96","mass":"32"}
{"name":"Darth Vader","height":"202","mass":"136"}
{"name":"Leia Organa","height":"150","mass":"49"}
{"name":"Owen Lars","height":"178","mass":"120"}
{"name":"Beru Whitesun lars","height":"165","mass":"75"}
{"name":"R5-D4","height":"97","mass":"32"}
{"name":"Biggs Darklighter","height":"183","mass":"84"}
{"name":"Obi-Wan Kenobi","height":"182","mass":"77"}
```

Compute all Star Wars character's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a>:

<p>

```bash
$ curl -s "https://swapi.co/api/people/" |
  pxi "json => json.results" -c jsonObj -a flatMap -K '["name","height","mass"]' |
  pxi "ch => (ch.bmi = ch.mass / (ch.height / 100) ** 2, ch)" -K '["name","bmi"]'
```

</p>
</summary>

We use pixie to compute each character's BMI.
The default chunker `line` and the default applier `map` are suitable to apply a BMI-computing function to each line.
Before serializing to the default format JSON, we only keep the name and bmi fields.
The `map` applier supports mutating function inputs, which might be a problem for other appliers, so be careful.

```json
{"name":"Luke Skywalker","bmi":26.027582477014604}
{"name":"C-3PO","bmi":26.89232313815483}
{"name":"R2-D2","bmi":34.72222222222222}
{"name":"Darth Vader","bmi":33.33006567983531}
{"name":"Leia Organa","bmi":21.77777777777778}
{"name":"Owen Lars","bmi":37.87400580734756}
{"name":"Beru Whitesun lars","bmi":27.548209366391188}
{"name":"R5-D4","bmi":34.009990434690195}
{"name":"Biggs Darklighter","bmi":25.082863029651524}
{"name":"Obi-Wan Kenobi","bmi":23.24598478444632}

Identify all obese Star Wars characters:

<p>

```bash
$ curl -s "https://swapi.co/api/people/" |
  pxi "json => json.results" -c jsonObj -a flatMap -K '["name","height","mass"]' |
  pxi "ch => (ch.bmi = ch.mass / (ch.height / 100) ** 2, ch)" -K '["name","bmi"]' |
  pxi "ch => ch.bmi >= 30" -a filter -K '["name"]'
```

</p>
</summary>

Finally, we use the `filter` applier to identify obese characters and keep only their names.

```json
{"name":"R2-D2"}
{"name":"Darth Vader"}
{"name":"Owen Lars"}
{"name":"R5-D4"}
```

As it turns out, Anakin could use some training.

Select PID and CMD from <code>ps</code>:

<p>

```bash
$ ps | pxi '([pid, tty, time, cmd]) => ({pid, cmd})' --from ssv
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie supports space-separated values, which is perfect for processing command line output.

```json
{"pid":"42978","cmd":"-zsh"}
{"pid":"42988","cmd":"-zsh"}
{"pid":"43006","cmd":"-zsh"}
{"pid":"43030","cmd":"-zsh"}
{"pid":"43067","cmd":"-zsh"}
```

Select file size and filename from <code>ls</code>:

<p>

```bash
$ ls -ahl / | pxi '([,,,,size,,,,file]) => ({size, file})' --from ssv
```

</p>
</summary>

Array destructuring is especially useful when working with space-separated values.

```json
{"size":"704B","file":"."}
{"size":"704B","file":".."}
{"size":"1.2K","file":"bin"}
{"size":"4.4K","file":"dev"}
{"size":"11B","file":"etc"}
{"size":"25B","file":"home"}
{"size":"64B","file":"opt"}
{"size":"192B","file":"private"}
{"size":"2.0K","file":"sbin"}
{"size":"11B","file":"tmp"}
{"size":"352B","file":"usr"}
{"size":"11B","file":"var"}
```

Allow JSON objects and lists in CSV:

<p>

```bash
$ echo '{"a":1,"b":[1,2,3]}\n{"a":2,"b":{"c":2}}' |
  pxi --to csv --no-fixed-length --allow-list-values
```

</p>
</summary>

Pixie can be told to allow JSON encoded lists and objects in CSV files.
Note, how pixie takes care of quoting and escaping those values for you.

```json
a,b
1,"[1,2,3]"
2,"{""c"":2}"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Decode JSON values in CSV:

<p>

```bash
$ echo '{"a":1,"b":[1,2,3]}\n{"a":2,"b":{"c":2}}' |
  pxi --to csv --no-fixed-length --allow-list-values |
  pxi --from csv 'evolve({b: JSON.parse})'
```

</p>
</summary>

JSON values are treated as strings and are not automatically parsed.
This is intentional, as pixie tries to keep as much out of your way as possible.
They can be transformed back into JSON by applying JSON.parse in a function.

```json
{"a":"1","b":[1,2,3]}
{"a":"2","b":{"c":2}}
```

## `.pxi` Module

Users may extend and modify `pxi` by providing a `.pxi` module.
If you wish to do that, create a `~/.pxi/index.js` file and insert the following base structure:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins:  [],
  context:  {},
  defaults: {}
}
```

The following sections will walk you through all capabilities of `.pxi` modules.
If you want to skip over the details and instead see sample code, visit [`pxi-pxi`][pxi-pxi]!

### Writing Plugins

You may write pixie plugins in `~/.pxi/index.js`.
Writing your own extensions is straightforward:

```js
const sampleChunker = {
  name: 'sample',
  desc: 'is a sample chunker.',
  func: ({verbose}) => (data, prevLines) => (
    // * Turn data into an array of chunks
    // * Count lines for better error reporting throughout pxi
    // * Collect error reports: {msg: String, line: Number, info: String}
    //   If verbose > 0, include line in error reports
    //   If verbose > 1, include info in error reports
    // * Return errors, chunks, lines, the last line, and all unchunked data
    {err: [], chunks: [], lines: [], lastLine: 0, rest: ''}
  )
}

const sampleDeserializer = {
  name: 'sample',
  desc: 'is a sample deserializer.',
  func: ({verbose}) => (chunks, lines) => (
    // * Deserialize chunks to jsons
    // * Collect error reports: {msg: String, line: Number, info: Chunk}
    //   If verbose > 0, include line in error reports
    //   If verbose > 1, include info in error reports
    // * Return errors and deserialized jsons
    {err: [], jsons: []}
  )
}

const sampleApplier = {
  name: 'sample',
  desc: 'is a sample applier.',
  func: (functions, {verbose}) => (jsons, lines) => (
    // * Turn jsons into other jsons by applying all functions
    // * Collect error reports: {msg: String, line: Number, info: Json}
    //   If verbose > 0, include line in error reports
    //   If verbose > 1, include info in error reports
    // * Return errors and serialized string
    {err: [], jsons: []}
  )
}

const sampleSerializer = {
  name: 'sample',
  desc: 'is a sample serializer.',
  func: ({verbose}) => jsons => (
    // * Turn jsons into a string
    // * Collect error reports: {msg: String, line: Number, info: Json}
    //   If verbose > 0, include line in error reports
    //   If verbose > 1, include info in error reports
    // * Return errors and serialized string
    {err: [], str: ''}
  )
}
```

The `name` is used by pixie to select your extension,
the `desc` is displayed in the options section of `pxi --help`, and
the `func` is called by pixie to transform data.

The sample extensions are bundled to the sample plugin, as follows:

```js
const sample = {
  chunkers:      [sampleChunker],
  deserializers: [sampleDeserializer],
  appliers:      [sampleApplier],
  serializers:   [sampleSerializer]
}
```

### Extending Pixie with Plugins

Plugins can come from two sources:
They are either written by users, as shown in the previous section, or they are installed in `~/.pxi/` as follows:

```bash
$ npm install pxi-sample
```

If a plugin was installed from `npm`, it has to be imported into `~/.pxi/index.js`:

```js
const sample = require('pxi-sample')
```

Regardless of whether a plugin was defined by a user or installed from `npm`,
all plugins are added to the `.pxi` module the same way:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins:  [sample],
  context:  {},
  defaults: {}
}
```

`pxi --help` should now list the sample plugin extensions in the options section.

> :speak_no_evil: Adding plugins may **break the `pxi` command line tool**!
> If this happens, just remove the plugin from the list and `pxi` should work normal again.
> Use this feature responsibly.

### Including Libraries like Ramda or Lodash

Libraries like [Ramda][ramda] and [Lodash][lodash] are of immense help when writing functions to transform JSON objects
and many heated discussions have been had, which of these libraries is superior.
Since different people have different preferences, pixie lets the user decide which library to use.

First, install your preferred libraries in `~/.pxi/`:

```bash
$ npm install ramda
$ npm install lodash
```

Next, add the libraries to `~/.pxi/index.js`:

```js
const R = require('ramda')
const L = require('lodash')

module.exports = {
  plugins:  [],
  context:  Object.assign({}, R, {_: L}),
  defaults: {}
}
```

You may now use all Ramda functions without prefix, and all Lodash functions with prefix `_`:

```bash
$ pxi "prop('time')" < 2019.jsonl > out.jsonl
$ pxi "json => _.get(json, 'time')" < 2019.jsonl > out.jsonl
```

> :hear_no_evil: Using Ramda and Lodash may have a **negative impact on performance**! Use this feature responsibly.

### Including Custom JavaScript Functions

Just as you may extend pixie with third-party libraries like Ramda and Lodash,
you may add your own functions.

This is as simple as adding them to the context in `~/.pxi/index.js`:

```js
const getTime = json => json.time

module.exports = {
  plugins:  [],
  context:  {getTime},
  defaults: {}
}
```

After adding it to the context, you call your function as follows:

```bash
$ pxi "json => getTime(json)" < 2019.jsonl > out.jsonl
$ pxi "getTime" < 2019.jsonl > out.jsonl
```

### Changing `pxi` Defaults

You may **globally** change default chunkers, deserializers, appliers, and serializers in `~/.pxi/index.js`, as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins:  [],
  context:  {},
  defaults: {
    chunker:      'sample',
    deserializer: 'sample',
    appliers:     'sample',
    serializer:   'sample',
    noPlugins:    false
  }
}
```

> :see_no_evil: Defaults are assigned **globally** and changing them may **break existing `pxi` scripts**!
> Use this feature responsibly.

## `id` Plugin

`pxi` includes the [`id`][pxi-id] plugin that comes with the following extensions:

|                   | Description                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id` chunker      | Returns each data as a chunk.                                              |
| `id` deserializer | Returns all chunks unchanged.                                              |
| `id` applier      | Does not apply any functions and returns the JSON objects unchanged.       |
| `id` serializer   | Applies Object.prototype.toString to the input and joins without newlines. |
